# For Users

`saveme - application to inform GP & loved ones that your life is in danger.`

This application can also be used as a regular call timer.

**Feel safe, the timer does not need internet connection.**

How to use:
1. During the application **first start**, you must select the number from your contact list for the call or enter the number manually.
You **can select several numbers** and quickly switch between them in the "numbers to call" option.
2. It is necessary to set the timer time after which the call will take place.
3. Once the call number is selected and the timer is set, the application is ready to use.
4. The **next time application starts** - the countdown will start **immediately**, and when it ends a call will take place..
Only the first call must be confirmed. Therefore, we recommend that you wait and test the first call.
Also, **if you have two SIM cards**, select the default one in settings from which the calls will be made. Otherwise you will have to confirm the call every time.
5. The timer can be stopped with the "Stop" button, after which the application will turn off. Also, timer can be paused by going to application settings.

The timer does not guarantee that the person being called will pick up the phone.
It is one time call.

In order for the application to work properly, it needs to save the file with the added and selected numbers and the file with the required countdown time.
Therefore, you should give **permission to save them on your storage, as well as permission to create a call.**
Also give permission to access contacts if your number is selected from the contact list.
